## Coursework 2: Data Anonymisation and Sharing
The repository contains submitted code files for the purpose of Coursework 2 on Data Anonymisation and Sharing as part of Clinical Data Management, a term 1 module undertaken by MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning students at Imperial College London.

The coursework involved the anonymisation of given insurance customer data for the purpose of improving k-anonymity values before sharing for analysis purposes to both researchers and governmental institutions. Of interest in this dataset was the presence of the Wanderlust gene in individuals.

## Anonymisation Methods
The methods used include deletion of direct identifiers, banding, pseudoanonymisation, and aggregation. 

## Files of Interest
* CDM_CW2_G8: Contains all files submitted by group 8; made up of anonymised data (with data documentation) and supplementary materials that included a Python script that produced the anonymised data and a slide deck explaining the methodology

## Dataset
The preliminary dataset contained 1000 rows and 18 columns of data collected through in person surveys.
